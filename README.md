## Usage

**In JavaScript:**
Hereâ€™s how to use it in your JavaScript code:

```javascript
const wordGenerator = require("wordwhize");

async function main() {
  let word = await wordGenerator(5, "fr"); // Generate a 5-letter word in French
  console.log(word);
}
main()
```

**Command-line usage:**
To use it from the terminal, provide the word length and language as arguments:

```bash
npx wordwhize 7 en
```
This will generate a 7-letter word in English.

You can also use the following options:

`--list` to display available languages.
`--support` or `--s` to show help with support links.
`--random` to generate a word of random length between 1 and 20 characters.
**For example:**

```bash
npx wordwhize --random en
```
This will generate a random-length word in English.

**Note:**

You can customize the language code (e.g., "en" for English, "fr" for French) as needed.
